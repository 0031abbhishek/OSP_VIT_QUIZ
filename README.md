Abstract:
Quiz is a very important part of education and content revising. With the help of VIT Quiz Portal,particular faculty would be able to create and conduct quizzes for students who are registered to there respective courses.They not need to depend upon some external source,it would be available inside the VTOP under Quiz Section.Students can attend Quizes inside VTOP and can view there results in future under marks section in VTOP.Quizes will be time controled and amount of time alloted will be finalize by the admin itself.This idea can be implemented in  any colleges, universities or at home to check the preparation of students and revise contents of different courses.Server load will be not an issue in this case because number of students would always less than 150.

Manual systems are very time consuming and difficult to grade. This  would be able to develop, conduct and check the quizzes thus reducing the burden of academics staff and will provide efficient evaluation of students.

Problem statement:

We have came with some innovative idea which can overcome some problematic situation:

1. QUIZ will be available inside VTOP Login , so that they not need to depend on some other external source.
2. Marks of the quiz will be automaticaly reflects in the marks section inside VTOP,so that faculty don't need to do any after work after conducting Quiz.
3.Admin will be able to add Questions from there admin Login on VTOP, will provide a proper framework for faculty so that they find easy to add Questions.


Reason for chosen this topic?

After going through VTOP we have seen one section is missing and that is QUIZ section where Students can easily give there quiz exams in single login in VTOP without any interruption or depending on certain external source. They can easily see the dates of the quiz in asssignments section and easily traverse to quiz section in same portal. This will somehow reduce some manpower and would be more efficient for academics faculty and students too.
